### We believe

* **COLLABORATION IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS**

Software quality requires a joint and continuous effort. For that reason, we strive for long-term partnerships with our customers.

* **SET THE BAR AS HIGH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN**

By putting effort into innovative solutions and setting the standard higher after every achievement, we want to be a front-runner in our market.

* **HAPPY PEOPLE PERFORM BETTER**

That’s why we have launched *BrightBeing*: with this concept, we offer *Bright* people a tailored career path, expert support on the job, as well as individual mental, psychological and physical coaching.

* **REAL QUALITY REQUIRES A HOLISTIC VIEW**

Cost-effective software quality requires more than just testing skills. Together with the customer, we look at the complete picture and focus our efforts on high return on investment.

### My role as an intern

Together with 2 other students, we have been tasked to build a test automatisation framework. It should work on Web applications as well as on Mobile. It should work globally, but we start testing on an existing application made by previous interns called "B-Tube". It's a digital movie rental app. We have the freedom of using any technologies we would like, but our best bet is to use Selenium and Appium to achieve our goals.
